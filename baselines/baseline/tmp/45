sandra bullock and roger a. deakins latour/rex/shutterstock it 's roger deakins ' first oscar !
how has it taken this long ?
arguably the most talented cinematographer in the industry , it 's fantastic to finally see him get the reward he so richly deserves .
he 's been nominated 13 times before first for the shawshank redemption , through fargo , true grit and sicario and lost every time .
i 'm surprised there has n't been a poor roger meme .
that 's now two awards for blade runner 2049 .
