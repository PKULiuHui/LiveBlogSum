nelson/epa ah , not a surprise here given how many awards she has already won for her role as tonya harding 's abusive mother , but it 's a tad disappointing given how excellent laurie metcalf and lesley manville were in their nominated performances .
still , like rockwell , janney is a performer who has been working for so long and her career before this performance was worthy of recognition .
i did it all by myself , she jokes as she gets on stage .
it 's a heartfelt speech but , man , metcalf was robbed .
