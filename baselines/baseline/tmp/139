this is the third time christopher plummer has been nominated for an oscar since 2010 , this year for playing j paul getty in all the money in the world .
plummer of course replaced kevin spacey following sexual harassment and assault allegations against spacey in november .
quite the turnaround .
plummer was n't thrilled about being named the oldest actor to be nominated for an oscar .
still , if he wins , he 'll probably forget about the ageism .
