strauss/invision/ap so it 's the first award of the night and it looks like each major category is getting a montage of previous winners which feels like it 's going to add more time to an overlong ceremony but sure , okay !
no big surprise here since rockwell had won every precursor up until tonight .
most critics wanted to see dafoe win but there 's something deserving about the work rockwell has done in the industry , even if this might not be his finest role .
run that clock jimmy , i want to get that ski jet or whatever that was , he jokes .
he has a pre-written story about his youth and his love of movies which gets major laughs .
he also thanks everyone who has ever looked at a billboard .
it 's a charming speech , his best on the awards circuit so far .
could this be the first of many awards tonight for three billboards ?
i think so .
