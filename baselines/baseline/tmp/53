backstage kobe bryant is greeted with cheers and a few boos , then receives solely softball questions about his transition from athlete to writer , with no questions about the rape accusation , # metoo or time 's up .
this sense of validation , it 's crazy man , he smiled .
the hardest thing for athletes when starting over is you have to quiet the ego learn the basics of things .
my advice to athletes is find something you want to do then everything else tends to make sense .
underscoring the blurred lines in hollywood 's sexual misconduct backlash , bryant lauded two figureheads of the female empowerment oprah winfrey and shonda rhimes as mentors .
when you have mentors like that in your life everything tends to work itself out .
bryant gets a high-five as he walks out to applause and grimaces from some journalists who did n't get to ask questions .
