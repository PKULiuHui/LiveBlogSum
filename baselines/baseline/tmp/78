first snafu of the night , but a mini one no one will care about .
backstage the media receive a transcript of the best supporting actor 's press conference comments while sam rockwell is still talking , and the transcript turns out to be of casey affleck from last year .
rockwell says he had several months to prepare for the role .
i did some ridealongs with some cops .
i met with a skin graft doctor who introduced me to some burn victims .
i had two or three months so got to indulge in all this research .
