michael shannon , sally hawkins and octavia spencer in the shape of water /fox searchlight pictures after another awards season filled with wins , losses , politics , dresses and , you know , films , we 're reaching the dramatic conclusion with this year 's academy awards .
while most of the early indicators have implied that it would take another envelope switcheroo for an upset in the four acting categories ( can anything stop oldman , mcdormand , janney and rockwell ?
) , the best race is far from wrapped up .
guillermo del toro 's stylish romance the shape of water is out in front with 13 nominatons and is predicted to win a good chunk of them but quite often the most lauded film going in does n't always come out on top ( la la land , the revenant , gravity , lincoln and hugo all went in with the most yet all failed to win the big prize ) .
could divisive drama three billboards outside ebbing , missouri continue its winning streak ?
could get out be the first horror film to win since the silence of the lambs ?
could dunkirk prove the safe choice for voters ?
we 'll find out in a few hours .
it 's also set to be another politically charged ceremony with rumours of gun control badges being won on the red carpet and a # timesup moment in the telecast .
we 'll be here until late with our fashion experts taking over very soon .
get some snacks .
happy 90th oscars !
