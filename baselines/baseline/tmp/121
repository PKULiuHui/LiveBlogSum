so it looks like all the major stars did choose to shun ryan seacrest , as many had predicted .
the host has been accused of sexual harassment , something he denies , and despite this , e !
still chose to place him on the red carpet tonight .
as a result , his interviewees were mostly male ( mary j blige and allison janney were the rare exceptions ) and instead , abc has nabbed all of the major pre-ceremony exclusives .
and yeah this was interesting emily nussbaum ( @ emilynussbaum ) christopher plummer talking to ryan seacrest about the pleasurable risk involved in jumping in for kevin spacey has a very awkward vibe .
