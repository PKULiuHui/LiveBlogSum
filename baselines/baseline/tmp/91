latour/rex/shutterstock red carpet over , we can finally stop cringing through ryan seacrest getting snubbed by everyone apart from christopher plummer .
it 's kicking off quite shoddily with a vintage-y look at the night 's big stars with jimmy kimmel putting on a silly voice .
it 's at least better than last year because it features 100 % less of justin timberlake singing that song from trolls .
kimmel 's a slick host though and he 's immediately launched into the envelope drama from last year .
he 's telling his story for the first time and ensuring us that it will not happen again .
oscar is 90 years old this year which means he 's probably at home watching fox news , he jokes before praising the statuette 's lack of penis .
he 's gone on to talk about harvey weinstein being expelled from the academy ( applause ) and is now talking about the importance of setting an example about how hollywood needs to crack down on sexual harassment .
kimmel has also confirmed that advocates from various causes will speak throughout the night which should make for an interesting ceremony and will piss off the right which is always fun to watch .
the emphasis is definitely on the academy as a cause for change , talking about this year 's diverse set of nominees .
mark wahlberg just got some applause for donating the money he demanded for the all the money in the world reshoots .
yay ?
he 's doing the standard out random nominees and making jokes about them but he 's doing it with finesse .
we do n't make films like call me by your name to make money , we do films like call me by your name to piss off mike pence , was one of his better lines .
