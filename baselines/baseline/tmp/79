the night already feels a bit too montage heavy for me , especially given that the montages are all really dreadfully long .
give the winners that time instead .
but yeah we 're already on our 67th ( ? )
of the night running through a seemingly random selection of films from moonlight to forrest gump to it to precious towest side story to inception .
it 's self-indulgent and long and please academy , do less .
it 's like film has died and they are paying tribute to the whole medium .
