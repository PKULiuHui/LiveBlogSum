/kobal/rex/shutterstock a much-deserved win here for three-time nominee mark bridges who designed the incredible dresses in paul thomas anderson 's pitch-black romantic comedy .
it 's also a very short speech which suggests that mr bridges wants himself that jet-ski .
could phantom thread go on to win more tonight ?
it 's unlikely to get the big ones , but jonny greenwood is in with a shot for his score so we 'll see .
