the sentiment on twitter is similarly pleased for janney but less pleased for i , tonya richard lawson ( @ rilaws ) weird to be mad that allison janney has an oscar !
laurence `` laura dern '' barber ( @ bortlb ) i wish i loved allison janney 's performance in i , tonya as much as i do the phrase `` academy award winner allison janney '' .
# oscars scott tobias ( @ scott tobias ) the supporting actor and actress speeches did an excellent job making me feel great about performances i did n't want to win .
