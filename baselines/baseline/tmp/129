laura dern has arrived , in a white slit-shouldered asymmetric gown .
more white , then we smell a trend , although dern is noticeably not wearing a time 's up pin .
given she is one of the campaign 's original cadre , that she has avoided the black-and-time's-up-pin combo of red carpets late , this looks set to be the direction the nascent organisation is hoping to take .
