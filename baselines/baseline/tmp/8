not everyone was quite so taken with mcdormand 's speech given the film she was winning her award for : linda holmes ( @ nprmonkeysee ) three billboards is not a very good movie to try to make an inclusion point with , but i assume she actually means it and it 's all valuable .
# oscars yolanda machado ( @ sassymamainla ) i love frances , but does she not watch her own movies ?
inclusion ? ?
uh .
the people of color in three billboards were tokens .
and yes- take a look .
how many women of color do you see ?
mm hmm # oscars corinne ( @ yourpalimpsest ) frances mcdormand 's speech and call for an `` inclusion rider '' may have carried more weight to me if three billboards featured any significant diverse actors and/or characters other than her instead of only having a few minor roles who were treated as props and punchlines .
