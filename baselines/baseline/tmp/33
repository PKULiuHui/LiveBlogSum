jackson/reuters after the academy wisely decided not to have casey affleck up on stage , we instead have jodie foster and jennifer lawrence presenting the penultimate award of the night .
as with the other acting awards of the night , this one was a given .
mcdormand has managed a string of speeches about how much she seems to despise winning awards this season but this one was slightly different .
she has asked for all of the female nominees in the audience to stand up together , which they did , and then wants to leave them all with two words : inclusion writer ?
inclusion writer ?
inclusion rider ?
inclusion water ?
more soon .
