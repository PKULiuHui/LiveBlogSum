rita moreno at the oscars in the same dress 56 years later .
strauss/invision/ap the duchess of cambridge is known for repeat wearing clothes but rita moreno , presenting an award here , showed us how it 's really done .
she is wearing a dress that she originally wore to the oscars in 1962 when she won best supporting actress for west side story , made from japanese obi fabric .
no wonder she looks so triumphant .
