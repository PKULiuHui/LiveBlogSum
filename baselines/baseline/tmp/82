bryan fogel and dan cogan , who made icarus .
anzuoni/reuters presented by greta gerwig and laura dern , who should be mother and daughter in an upcoming film from noah baumbach already , many thought this would go to agnã¨s varda 's faces places but instead it 's gone to the superb netflix documentary icarus , about doping in russia .
it 's a timely , fascinating film and a deserving winner .
it 's dedicated to the whistleblower who is still in hiding after taking part in the film .
given the film 's understandably negative view of corruption in russia , it might not be a favorite with our putin-loving president .
