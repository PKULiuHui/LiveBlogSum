pizzello/invision/ap anyone else have a bit of ptsd watching faye dunaway and warren beatty return to the stage to present best the pair returned and everyone held their breath but , yes , it looks like the shape of water has actually won !
given that it had the most nominations tonight , it 's hardly a shock but three billboards had won so many precursors that it was still up in the air .
guillermo del toro is back on stage and he 's talking about his influences and he wants to dedicate it to every young film-maker around the world .
it 's a great speech , his second great speech of the night .
the music cut off one of the producers which led to boos .
great way to end the evening !
