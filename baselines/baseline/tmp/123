mary j. blige harrison/getty images as the first person ever to be nominated for an acting award and for an original song , mary j blige is already a star of the oscars 2018 .
her white dress with asymmetric bodice is an exercise in alpha glamour , while the teeny-tiny bag is a touching addition that proves even blige needs somewhere to put her phone and lipstick .
she 'll need those later when she heads to the afterparty in her honour to be staged by jay-z and beyoncã© .
winning .
