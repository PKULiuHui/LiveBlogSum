and here we are with the slightly patronizing spectacle of well-dressed well-paid actors going in to surprise the little people who are busy enjoying their movie .
there are screams of surprise as gal gadot arrives with a basket full of snacks .
it 's an odd sight .
especially now that meryl streep is waving back to them via the big screen .
kimmel is ridiculing the smell of the cinema because ya know , real people stink , right ?
ansel elgort is now firing hot dogs into the audience .
there is so much screaming that nothing discernible can be heard .
is this happening or am i just really tired ?
via video feed , margot robbie , lupita nyong'o , jimmy kimmel , and gal gadot exit the theatre with baskets of sweets .
