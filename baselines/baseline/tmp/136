the national hispanic media coalition has staged a protest of the oscars to draw attention to the lack of latino representation in hollywood .
we have underrepresentation that is so severe that we can not continue to let it go year after year , alex nogales , president of the coalition , told the guardian before the weekend 's protests .
this is a situation that has been intolerable for years .
although latinos comprise 18 % of the us population and 23 % of moviegoers , only 3 % of speaking characters in 2016 's top 100 films were latinos , according to a university of southern california study .
chelsea edwards ( @ abc7chelsea ) chanting # oscarssowhite , enough is enough , dozens of protesters are gathering at sunset and # hollywood to speak out against what they call a decades-long exclusion of latinos from movie jobs .
they 're going to march to the dolby theatre .
@ twitterid7 # nhmc disney 's nominated film coco , which tells the story of a mexican boy stuck in the land of the dead , had a latino cast , and oscar isaac , who was born in guatemala , starred in the latest star wars trilogy .
guillermo del toro 's film the shape of water is also leading the oscar 's race with 13 nominations .
but no latinos were nominated for acting oscars this year .
advocates plan to escalate the campaigns and pressure film executives to meet with the organizations pushing for better latino representation , nogales said .
if leadership of the studios do n't come and say let 's talk , we 'll call them out by name and see how they like to be called racists and bigots .
