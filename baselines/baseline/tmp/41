pizzello/invision/ap that tough old category i 've been blathering on about all night finally has a winner and it 's the right choice !
it might be the less cool option but for anyone who has seen the film , its hard to complain about this decision .
coco now has two oscars if you 're counting .
slightly awkward moment as the music started playing the winners off just as a tribute was made to a dead parent .
nice !
