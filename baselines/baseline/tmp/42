/fox searchlight pictures while jonny greenwood 's phantom thread score would have been the more unusual and interesting option , it 's hard to get mad at alexandre desplat .
his score is an incredibly lovely element of an incredibly lovely film .
it 's his second oscar and the second award for del toro 's film tonight so far .
