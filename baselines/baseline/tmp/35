grillot/afp/getty images jane fonda and helen mirren are up to present best actor and fonda compares the stage to something seen in barbarella .
this one was never really in question , and although it would have been nice to see newcomers chalamet or kaluuya or veteran day-lewis win ( all of whom were far more deserving ) , oldman is another performer tonight who has been deserving of recognition for so long .
the controversy swirling around both an accusation of domestic violence from the 90s ( which he denies ) and a nutso playboy interview where he expressed sympathy for mel gibson , has n't stopped him from claiming victory tonight .
it 's an earnest speech and he appears genuinely choked up on stage .
will the best actress win be as predictable ?
i think so !
