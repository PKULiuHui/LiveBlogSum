agnes varda strauss/invision/ap could tonight see any records broken ?
taking a look at the nominations , the following winners would prove to be notable hall-of-famers : at 88 , christopher plummer would be the oldest acting winner ever , beating the record he already has after winning for beginners in 2012 .
mudbound 's rachel morrison is already the first female nominee in the category of best cinematography so if she wins , she will , you 've guessed it , be the first female winner .
if jordan peele manages to beat favourite guillermo del toro for best director , he 'll be the first black winner in this category .
at 22 , call me by your name 's timothã©e chalamet would be the youngest best actor winner , beating out adrien brody who won when he was 29 for the pianist .
the most likely of all tonight 's record-breakers is agnã¨s varda , who at 89 is already the oldest nominee ever so if her acclaimed film faces places wins best documentary ( and it really could ) then she 'd , yep , be the oldest winner too .
