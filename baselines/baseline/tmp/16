remember all that talk of the tiffany haddish/paul thomas anderson collaboration ?
well he 's keen to work with her and they 've been talking together about what it could be .
tonight , she revealed a tad more to yahoo : it could be several things , we 're trying to figure it out .
either it 'll take place in south central la back when it was poppin ' off of south central boulevard i do n't know if you know , central boulevard was like sunset back in the day , back in the 30s and 40s .
or maybe it 'll be like a wayback period piece that takes place in the 1600s .
i bet you did n't know black people was in england then , did you ?
we was !
