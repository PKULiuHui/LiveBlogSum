the list of stars presenting awards tonight is both impressive and impresssively diverse .
we 'll be seeing margot robbie , tiffany haddish , chadwick boseman , emily blunt , jodie foster , zendaya , kumail nunjiani , helen mirren , dave chappelle , lupita nyong'o , taraji p henson and many others .
but will there be any viral hosting skits ?
the oscars is usually light on these ( the globes is usually the home for these ) but they have invited three key weinstein accusers to present ( salma hayek , ashley judd and annabella sciorra ) which suggests an emotive tribute to the women who have spoken up .
