sjodin/getty images so there we go !
it all seemed so staid this year given the fact that just 12 months ago we were still gasping over envelope-gate and the fact that a tiny-budgeted film about the life of a black gay man won the oscar for best but still , despite some seeing it as the safe option , the shape of water is hardly oscarbait .
it 's a film about a mute woman , an older gay man and a black woman working together to help save an aquatic creature in the 60s .
oh and it features an interspecies sex scene .
not exactly a lasse hallstrã¶m joint huh ?
the acting categories were a lot more predictable but as many have already said , all four actors are great , just maybe not in those roles ?
the ceremony itself was mixed .
there were less desperate attempts to go viral but kimmel was nothing more then reliable .
it was also , despite what they might want you to think , a poor year for female winners with just six women taking home oscars .
there 'll be more post-show analysis coming soon but for now , this is your lot .
happy oscars !
