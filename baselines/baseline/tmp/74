/fox searchlight pictures lupita nyong'o and kumail nunjiani are presenting and they are talking about the fact that their names are hard to pronounce and that they are both immigrants .
they 're talking about standing with the dreamers out there and how they stand with them .
it 's interesting to see a political bit written into the script as usually these are improvised .
aaaaaand phew , the shape of water is n't going to go home empty-handed tonight as the most-nominated film sometimes does .
given how ravishing the film looked , this feels like a smart choice although i think blade runner stans will disagree
