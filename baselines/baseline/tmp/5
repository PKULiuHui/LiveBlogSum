guillermo del toro has the best oscar , and the card to prove it 's no mix-up .
mccandless/getty images here are some backstage quotes from the big winners : i am so proud to be a part of a time that 's the beginning of a movement , where i feel like the best films of every genre are being brought to me by black directors jordan peele i have to be at a table read for mom at 10am tomorrow , so i 'm going back to work allison janney i ca n't say what it would be like to win an oscar in any other year , but to win it for playing winston makes it doubly special .
it 's been an unforgettable experience gary oldman i think every time we ( mexico ) can demonstrate in any form , sports , science , art or culture , what we bring to the world discourse is extremely important .
when we do it , it 's important to remember where we 're from , and honoring your roots and your country guillermo del toro
