so what did we learn ?
a whiteout could have been the new blackout .
gold is what to wear if you have n't been nominated .
wear your cause on your pin , be it black lives matter or time 's up .
but when it came to a potential time 's up dress code , the party line was there was no party line .
the conversation , it seems , has moved off-carpet and into the ether .
or , tonight , more likely the podium .
